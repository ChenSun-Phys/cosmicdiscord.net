Here, I list a few of my recent projects. This page may get outdated over time. If it does, please refer to my [InspireHEP](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1325019?ui-citation-summary=true) page for a complete list of my publications. If you are a student (at any stage of your career) and are curious about what I'm busy with these days, drop me a line!

I study very different phenomena ranging from astrophysics, and cosmology, to low-energy precision measurements in the lab. I am mostly passionate about novel low-energy observables of high energy theories beyond the Standard Model (SM) of elementary particle physics, which provide elegant solutions to the open questions to date: What is dark matter? Why does the strong interaction preserve the time-reversal symmetry? Are there any gauge sectors beyond the SM gauge group? What can gravitational waves tell us about the inflation era of our Universe and the properties of the dark sector? 

In short, they are under the common theme of searching for new physics with low-energy observables in the lab and cosmos.

{% include module.html image_path="/assets/projimg/amr.png"  alignment="right" title="Resonantly enhanced photon-axion conversion at ALPS-II experiment" doi="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10925" url="https://github.com/ChenSun-Phys/axion-magnetic-resonance" description="Light-shining-through-walls experiments remain to be one of the most accurate ways to probe axions. I identify the optimal experimental setup to induce a resonance in the axion-photon-magnetic field system. The conversion between axions and photons can be greatly enhanced by a helical magnetic profile. I show that light-shining-through-walls experiments such as CAST and ALPS can be enhanced by 2 orders of magnitude (!) with existing helical magnet technology. See [arXiv:2308.10925](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10925) for the discussion of the experimental setup, the noise analysis, different analytical approaches, relation to previous works, and a lot more!

While it is widely known that axion effective field theory can address this discrepancy, we flesh out the challenges to UV complete these models due to the low cut-off scale combined with the current bounds from exotic Higgs decays, electroweak precision measurements, and light charged fermions.

However, the particle properties unique to ultralight particles of mass around $$10^{-20}$$ electronvolt start to manifest due to the so-called quantum pressure. I show that galaxy rotation curves are particularly good at probing such structures. I performed a thorough analysis of 175 disk galaxies and yielded one of the strongest robust constraints on ultralight dark matter to date.

Photons traversing these structures will get extra dimming due to some of them converting to axions en route, which in turn biases the distance measurements that rely on the magnitude. In the early 2000s, it was conjectured that this could explain then newly discovered accelerated expansion of the Universe without invoking dark energy. Nowadays, evidence of dark energy is well-established across different channels, so I turned the idea to its head to probe/constrain the existence of axions using Type Ia supernovae and galaxy clusters and found interesting results.

It turns out that it can address a previously known anomaly in the quasar data set better than any non-standard cosmology models. In particular, the so-called UV-X-ray relation of quasars can be effectively modified due to the energy dependence of photon-to-axion conversion en route in IGM magnetic fields.

This Bose-enhancement happens when there is a \"dense\" photon bath resulting in a large photon occupation number. Taking axions as an example, while one photon is indistinguishable from the ambient photons, the other travels in the direction opposite to the stimulating source to conserve energy and momentum. I identify that this \"echo\" photon is a prominent signal for photons sources that were _historically_ bright. [Phys.Rev.D 105 (2022) 7, 075006](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.075006).

An interesting question is what fundamental new physics can it teach us? In this project, I demonstrate that gravitational signals from binary mergers can tell us about the global structures of the axion potential! The idea is that dense structures (i.e. boson stars) axions form depend on the axion potential, while the gravitational waves depend on the compactness and size of the structures. This lays out a clear way of connecting macroscopic observables (gravitational wave signals) to microscopic fundamental physics (axion-like particles). Check out [JCAP 04 (2019) 008

Do you know that a super slow phase transition can also source gravitational waves in a very different way? This is what I checked in this project. The idea is that the slow phase transition bubbles during inflation get stretched out of the horizon shortly after they form. Upon re-entering the horizon they lead to strong density perturbation, which in turn causes a perturbation of the metric. This gives us the gravitational waves that can be measured by many current and future gravitational wave detectors. Big shout out to Joel Barir, a student at Tel Aviv U., who did a fantastic job in this project! [Phys. Rev.
