Now let's continue to understand the recent g-2 result.

### Classical value
Just like the classical current loop, or the classical approximation of hydrogen, the magnetic dipole moment is associated to how fast it rotates. In quantum mechanics, the value is fixed by the electron property, spin, being 1/2. The ratio between the magnetic moment and the spin, in the unit of "half-of-charge-mass-ratio" is two.

### QED computation
However, as is understood now, "on-shell" particles -- particles that are stable and can have long lifetime -- are not the only building blocks in our universe. In a theory developed spanning from the 20s to 50s called quantum field theory (QED to be specific,) it is proposed that virtual particles, particle states that have very short lifetime and whose "mass" could be very different from their on-shell counterparts, can momentarily appear out of vacuum and quickly disappear due to the Heisenberg principle. This revolutionized the way people perceive how fundamental particles interact with each other. However, the theory suffers great problem in making predictions due to a problem related to what is now known as renormalization. Without properly subtracting certain terms and compare with experimental boundary values, the theory suffers infinities here and there, rendering it useless. This is so until around 1950s when Freeman Dyson, Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger, and Shinichiro Tomonaga developed the modern version of the renormalization procedure. Electron g-2 was the first big test, as the term was predicted by (renormalized) QED and was ready to be compared with the experimental results. This was done in 1948 by Schwinger, and it was tested to be consistent with the experiment up to five digits, which was a miracle!

### New physics contribution
There have been a lot of models trying to explain the tension in the last decade. The rough idea is that those virtual particles should not only include the Standard Model (SM) particles that talk to electrons and muons, they should also include those particles beyond SM, if they couple to electrons/muons as well.

In particular, a class of them, though theoretically appealing for various reasons were only considering low energy effective theories. In our recent paper, we point out that these models are very hard to build without violating other existing experiments. In other words, if these models are the answer to the missing piece that caused the mismatch between the experiment and theoretical prediction, they should come with other particles light enough that have already been observed at other collider experiments.
