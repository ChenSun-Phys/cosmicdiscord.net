Some fun facts: the Sun is 1 astronomical unit away, which is 1.5$\times 10^8$ kilometers away from us -- that is seven zeros after 15 -- or eight minutes 19 seconds away if you travel with the speed of light; the center of the Milky Way is about eight kpc (kilo-parsec) or about 26000 light years away from us; some of the old supernova extends beyond one billion parsec away; cosmic microwave background radiation is about 14 billion parsecs away. Have you ever thought about how distances are measured at the cosmological scale? While that is definitely interesting enough to go through carefully, let's look at two types of distance measurements first. The method based on how "luminous" an object looks, and that based on how "big" an object looks. Technically, the two methods lead to two different physical quantities, the luminosity distance and the angular distance, but we can skip that technicality for now. 

### Luminosity distance
Now imagine you have an emergency lantern, and you have had it for many years so you know exactly how bright it is. One time you and your friend go to caving. Your friend, unfortunately like me, has a very poor direction and tend to get lost very easily. Concerned about your friend, you lend them the emergency lantern and tell them to flash it if get separated and lost. The moment your friend turns it on, you immediately get some information: their direction -- the coordinate
