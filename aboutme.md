My name is Chen Sun. I am a theoretical physicist with focus on probing physics beyond the Standard Model with astrophysical observables. I'm currently working as a postdoc at Tel Aviv University. My previous stays include Brown University, Dartmouth College, and Virginia Tech, in reverse chronological order.
